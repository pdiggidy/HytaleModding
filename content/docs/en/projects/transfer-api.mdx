**TransferAPI** is originally a Fabric API module that provides a common API for resource storage and transfer in Minecraft mods.
It is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing mod developers to create their own resource types and storage systems while maintaining compatibility with other mods that use the TransferAPI.

This project aims to strip down the original Fabric TransferAPI to its core concepts and re-implement it in a more general way that can be adapted to other platforms and use cases.

Later on, we will provide Hytale-specific implementations and examples.
