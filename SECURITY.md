2. **Email**
   - Send details to: `hello@hytalemodding.guide`
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

3. **Private Contact**
   - Open a GitHub issue with minimal details asking to discuss privately
   - A maintainer will reach out to establish secure communication

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggestions for fixing the issue
- Your GitHub username (for acknowledgment)

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to this project:

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Review security advisories for dependencies
   - Run `bun audit` regularly
